### What is VPN?
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public network such as the internet. It allows users to establish a private and protected network connection by routing their internet traffic through a remote server operated by the VPN service provider. This helps to safeguard data privacy and security, as the VPN encrypts the transmitted data, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Additionally, a VPN can help users bypass geographical restrictions, access blocked content, and enhance anonymity by masking their IP address. Overall, a VPN provides a secure and private online experience for users, protecting their data and online activities from potential threats.

### What is a proxy server?
A proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between a user's device and the internet. When a user sends a request for a web page or other online content, the request is first routed to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the destination server on behalf of the user. The proxy server retrieves the requested content and sends it back to the user. This process helps to improve privacy by masking the user's IP address and can also enhance security, cache frequently accessed content for faster retrieval, and provide access to blocked websites or services by appearing as a different location.

### What is Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)?
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution designed to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats on endpoints such as desktops, laptops, or servers. EDR solutions monitor and analyze endpoint activities in real-time, collecting data on processes, file changes, network connections, and user behavior. By leveraging advanced detection techniques and behavioral analytics, EDR solutions can identify malicious activities, detect unauthorized access, and mitigate the impact of security incidents. EDR also provides incident response capabilities, allowing security teams to investigate alerts, contain threats, and remediate affected endpoints. With its proactive approach, EDR strengthens an organization's security posture and helps protect against sophisticated cyber threats.

### Attack surface: 
The attack surface is the total number of ways that an attacker can exploit a system. This includes vulnerabilities in software, hardware, and configuration.

### Cyberattack: 
A cyberattack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, or to disrupt its operations. Cyberattacks can be carried out by individuals, groups, or nation-states.

### Cybercrime: 
Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer or network. This includes fraud, theft, and vandalism.

### Cybersecurity: 
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

### Data breach: 
A data breach is an incident in which sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized individuals. This can happen through a variety of means, such as hacking, phishing, or social engineering.

### Malware: 
Malware is software that is designed to harm a computer system. Malware can take many forms, such as viruses, worms, and Trojans.

### Phishing: 
Phishing is a type of social engineering attack in which the attacker sends emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source. The emails or text messages often contain a link that, when clicked, will take the victim to a fake website that looks like the real website. Once the victim enters their personal information on the fake website, the attacker can steal it.

### Ransomware: 
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. If the victim does not pay the ransom, the files will be lost.

### Zero-day attack: 
A zero-day attack is an attack that exploits a vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor. Zero-day attacks are often very difficult to defend against, as there is no patch available to fix the vulnerability.

### Monitoring and Detection: 
Continuously monitoring networks and systems for signs of potential security breaches or anomalies. This involves analyzing logs, network traffic, and security alerts to identify suspicious activities.

### Incident Response: 
Responding to security incidents in a timely manner to mitigate the impact and prevent further damage. This includes investigating and containing security breaches, conducting forensics analysis, and coordinating with relevant teams.

### Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing: 
Identifying and assessing potential vulnerabilities in systems and applications through regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Addressing and patching identified weaknesses to reduce the risk of exploitation.

### Access Control and Authentication: 
Managing user access to systems and data, implementing multi-factor authentication, and enforcing the principle of least privilege to minimize the attack surface.

### Security Awareness and Training: 
Educating employees and users about cybersecurity best practices, raising awareness about common threats such as phishing, and promoting a security-conscious culture.

### Security Policy Development: 
Developing and implementing security policies, standards, and guidelines that align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

### Security Tooling: 
Deploying and managing security tools such as firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and encryption mechanisms.

### Continuous Monitoring and Improvement: 
Regularly reviewing and updating security measures to adapt to emerging threats and vulnerabilities, as well as staying informed about the latest security trends and technologies.

### Types of Cyberattack:

* Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: Overloading a system or network to make it unavailable to legitimate users.

* Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack: A DoS attack conducted from multiple sources simultaneously to amplify its impact.

* Phishing Attack: Sending deceptive emails or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details.

* Malware: Malicious software designed to infect and compromise systems, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware.

* Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack: Intercepting and potentially modifying communications between two parties to eavesdrop or steal data.

* SQL Injection Attack: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications to insert malicious SQL code and gain unauthorized access to databases.

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users to steal data or execute unauthorized actions.

* Brute Force Attack: Repeatedly attempting different combinations of usernames and passwords to gain unauthorized access.

* Password Cracking: Using automated tools to guess weak passwords or decrypt encrypted passwords.

* Zero-Day Exploit: Exploiting software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the vendor and have not been patched yet.

* Drive-By Attack: Infecting a user's system simply by visiting a compromised website.

* Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals to divulge sensitive information through psychological manipulation.

* Advanced Persistent Threat (APT): A long-term, targeted cyberattack conducted by highly skilled and organized threat actors.

* Eavesdropping Attack: Intercepting and monitoring network communications to gather sensitive information.

* Insider Threat: A threat from employees, contractors, or business partners with authorized access to systems and data.

* IoT (Internet of Things) Attack: Exploiting vulnerabilities in connected devices to gain control over them or launch other attacks.

* DNS Spoofing: Manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) to redirect users to malicious websites.

* Ransomware Attack: Encrypting a victim's data and demanding a ransom for its release.

* Fileless Malware: Malicious code that operates in memory without leaving traces on the target's hard drive.

* Watering Hole Attack: Compromising websites frequently visited by the target audience to infect their devices.
